[__OctoberCMS__][] is a CMS built on Laravel 5.1. It started in May, 2014 But who gives a shit about its starting date?! Let's see the important parts.

October's headline is `Getting back to basics` ! And yes it does.

When I saw October CMS introduction video for the first time I told myself this is the exact world's missing piece! This is a new era in CMS platforms. I've been using Wordpress not because I love or even I like it, because there is no other choice!

A huge difference between __WordPress__ and __OctoberCMS__ code. If OctoberCMS is a ferrari so WordPress is a Fiat 128 ! No kidding xD

#### Why you should use OctoberCMS?
1- Built on the best PHP framework.

2- Fully Object Oriented Code.

3- Has a great extendable plugins system.

4- Has two different choices for your front-end programming (Twig, Blade).

5- You don't have to write a lot of code to create CRUD. You even won't write any code to build CRUD ! In just few clicks you will be able to create any number of CRUDs by installing `Rainlab.Builder` plugin.

#### Disadvantages of using OctoberCMS?
Actually the only one is that you won't like to work on low-quality-code platforms like WordPress again !

#### What components are installed with OctoberCMS?
1- Administrators with a powerful permissions system.

2- Different logs (Access logs, Mail logs etc.)

3- Well-designed backend.

And OctoberCMS backend control panel is available in huge number of languages. Not only English.

#### What plugins I should use first?
I highly recommend to install `Rainlab.Builder` plugin which is a powerful CRUD builder in the backend which creates migrations, models, controllers and forms for you without even writing one line of code. It even supports multi-languages.


#### Why I don't consider October a CMS?
Simply because It's not a CMS. It's a powerful platform or framework which facilitates your job and makes you a perfect extendable plugins system, So if you're working on a big web application you can divide your application into modules.

The CMS is just a plugin in October which even doesn't exist in fresh October installation. And sure you can make your own CMS or Blogging plugin yourself.

Another reason I call October a framework is that my plugin itself can be an independent MVC application, so in that case I don't have to use Twig (The default template engine in OctoberCMS) and I don't even have to use October's backend control panel, I can make my own within my plugin.
