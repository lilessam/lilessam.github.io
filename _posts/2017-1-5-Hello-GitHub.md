It's awesome to see something on the web like GitHub Pages !

It's been quite difficult to dive into Jekyll and GitHub pages. Through about 5 hours of concentration
I faced problems installing a theme, problems with my domain DNS settings and problems with understanding
how Jekyll and GitHub pages work.

Finally, I managed to create this simple personal blog after hours of customizing its theme (I'm so damn bad in Front-end development !!!).

Despite I have my own paid host on HostGator but once I saw this service I wanted to create my blog with it so badly!

I'm glad I managed to deal with this great service from __GitHub__.

Wait for my tutorials soon.
