Hey, there! My name is Ahmed Essam.

I am a programmer who create things for web. Most of my time is spent in front of my computer browsing the web and writing codes for next cool project. I am a lifelong learner. Self-educated and proud of that.

I started to dive into this field since the age of ten. I've worked in IT companies in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

You can see my resume [here][].

You can contact me using email or send me a tweet.
